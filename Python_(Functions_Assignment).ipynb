        "In Python, the main difference between a built-in function and a user-defined function lies in their origin and implementation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Built-in Function:**\n",
        "   - Built-in functions are functions that are already defined in the Python programming language. They are part of the Python standard library and are readily available for use without requiring additional definitions.\n",
        "   - Examples of built-in functions include `len()`, `print()`, `sum()`, `max()`, `min()`, and many others.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Here's an example using the built-in function `len()`:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
        "   length = len(my_list)\n",
        "   print(f\"The length of the list is: {length}\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **User-Defined Function:**\n",
        "   - User-defined functions are functions created by the user or programmer. They are defined using the `def` keyword followed by a function name, parameters, a colon, and a block of code.\n",
        "   - Users can define their own functions to encapsulate a specific set of operations, promote code reusability, and improve code organization.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Here's an example of a user-defined function:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
        "       return a + b\n",
        "\n",
        "   result = add_numbers(3, 5)\n",
        "   print(f\"The sum is: {result}\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "    this example, the `add_numbers` function takes two parameters (`a` and `b`) and returns their sum. The function is then called with arguments 3 and 5, and the result is printed.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, built-in functions are provided by Python itself, and users can readily use them without defining their functionality. User-defined functions, on the other hand, are created by users to meet specific requirements and encapsulate reusable pieces of code."

        "1. **Positional Arguments:**\n",
        "   - Positional arguments are passed to a function based on their position or order in the function call.\n",
        "   - The values you pass are assigned to the parameters in the same order as they appear in the function definition.\n",

        "    example, `3` is assigned to the parameter `a`, and `5` is assigned to the parameter `b` based on their positions in the function call.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Keyword Arguments:**\n",
        "   - Keyword arguments are passed to a function by explicitly specifying the parameter names along with their values.\n",
        "   - This allows you to pass arguments in a different order than they appear in the function definition.\n",
        "\n",

        "    example, the values `7` and `3` are assigned to the parameters `x` and `y` based on their names in the function call.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Combining Positional and Keyword Arguments:**\n",
        "   - You can also combine positional and keyword arguments in a function call. However, positional arguments must come before keyword arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   def multiply(a, b, c):\n",
        "       return a * b * c\n",

        "   result = multiply(2, c=4, b=3)\n",
        "   print(f\"The result is: {result}\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "    example, `2` is assigned to the parameter `a` as a positional argument, while `3` and `4` are assigned to `b` and `c` as keyword arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that when defining a function, you can have parameters with default values. Parameters with default values act as optional parameters, and if you don't provide a value for them in the function call, the default value will be used."

        "\n",
        "3. **Scope of Variables:**\n",
        "   - Lambda functions can only reference variables in their own scope and the global scope. They cannot modify variables from the enclosing scope without using workarounds.\n",
        "   - Regular functions can access variables from their own scope, the global scope, and any enclosing scopes. They can also modify variables from these scopes using the `global` and `nonlocal` keywords.\n",

        "\n",
        "Understanding scope is crucial for avoiding naming conflicts and understanding where variables are accessible in a program.

        "   - The function cannot modify the original object; instead, it operates on a local copy of the reference.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example:\n",

        "   ```python\n",
        "   def modify_immutable(value):\n",

        "\n",
        "In summary, Python uses a mechanism that is closer to \"pass by object reference.\" Whether the impact on the original object is visible outside the function depends on whether the object is mutable or immutable. Immutable objects are more similar to \"pass by value\" behavior, while mutable objects exhibit behavior more akin to \"pass by reference.\""
